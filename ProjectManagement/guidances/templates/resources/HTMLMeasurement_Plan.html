Measurement Plan 

1.                   Introduction 
[The introduction of the Measurement Plan should provide an overview of the entire document. It should include the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Measurement Plan.] 

1.1                Purpose 
[Specify the purpose of this Measurement Plan.] 

1.2                Scope 
[A brief description of the scope of this Measurement Plan; what Project(s) it is associated with, and anything else that is affected or influenced by this document.] 

1.3                Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations 
[This subsection should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the Measurement Plan.  This information may be provided by reference to the project Glossary.] 

1.4                References 
[This subsection should provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the Measurement Plan.  Each document should be identified by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.  Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.] 

1.5                Overview 
[This subsection should describe what the rest of the Measurement Plan contains and explain how the document is organized.] 

2.                   Management Goals and Subgoals 
[State what the goals of the measurement program are relative to the project in terms of achievement, improvement, and quality.] 

3.                   Metrics 
[Enumerate the metrics that are to be synthesized at regular intervals on the project to support the goals.]

Name 
 [Name of the metric and any known synonyms.] 
 
Definition 
 [The attributes of the entities that are measured using this metric, how the metric is calculated, and from which primitive metrics it is calculated.] 
 
Goals 
 [List of goals and questions related to this metric. Also some explanation as to why the metric is being collected.]
