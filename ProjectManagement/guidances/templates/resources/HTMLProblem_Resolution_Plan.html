Problem Resolution Plan 

 

1.                   Introduction 
[The introduction of the Problem Resolution Plan provides an overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Problem Resolution Plan.] 

1.1                Purpose 
[Specify the purpose of this Problem Resolution Plan.] 

1.2                Scope 
[A brief description of the scope of this Problem Resolution Plan; what Project(s) it is associated with and anything else that is affected or influenced by this document.] 

1.3                Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations 
[This subsection provides the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the Problem Resolution Plan.  This information may be provided by reference to the project's Glossary.] 

1.4                References 
[This subsection provides a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the Problem Resolution Plan.  Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.  Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.] 

1.5                Overview 
[This subsection describes what the rest of the Problem Resolution Plan contains and explains how the document is organized.] 

2.                   Problem Resolution Tasks 
[A brief description of the Problem Resolution tasks to be performed during the project. In this section you should describe the following: 

•      the procedure the project team will follow for reporting problems 

•      the procedure to be used for analyzing problems 

•      the procedure to be followed to implement appropriate corrective actions 

Where these procedures differ for different categories of problems (product, project, and process, see Activity: Develop Problem Resolution Plan), describe the procedure for each under a separate subsection.] 

3.                   Organization and Responsibilities 
[List the specific groups or individuals to be involved in the analysis and resolution of each category of problem and identify the tasks and responsibilities of each.] 

4.                   Tools and Techniques 
[List the tools and/or techniques that will be used to store problem information, analyze problems, and track the status of problems.] 

5.                   Problem Tracking 
[Identify problem categories and where they are stored and tracked, for example: 

•        Product and process problems (defects) may be stored and tracked in a Change Tracking System. 

•        Project problems (issues) may be tracked in an issues list, which is a component of the Status Assessment. 

•        Process problems (non-conformances) may be recorded in an audit report and then tracked in a Change Tracking System (as a kind of Change Request). 

•        Review anomalies will be recorded in the Review Record and tracked from there; if the scope of the problem requires it, a Change Request may be raised.]
